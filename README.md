# yatzy
Yahtzee game in Swedish, created with Java. It has no classes/objects to meet the limited scope of the course this project was a part of.
GUI uses a jswing as inscructed by the requirements of the course.
Open with editor of choice and run the YatzyJFrame.java file to play the game.
Begin with choosing 1 or 2 players, reset the game anytime.

Note that it does not work on smaller screens, as it was formatted for the screen used while the project was created and the size of the game panel seems to be fixed. Buttons located on the bottom might therefore be missing.
